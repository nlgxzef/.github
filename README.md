### Hi racers/players, [nlgzrgn](https://www.youtube.com/c/nlgzrgn) here!

ðŸ”­ I'm the main developer of [ExOpts Team](https://www.github.com/ExOptsTeam), who bring you NFS Extra Options and Race Fixes ASI script mods.  
ðŸŒ± I also code some NFS Unlimiters, which make add-on cars work properly, fix issues with the game and even allow more customization (only in NFSU2 and NFSMW).

âš¡ Fun fact:  I'm also a Windows addict! If you want to see some cool Windows experiments and other stuff, check out my [nlLuigi](https://www.youtube.com/c/nlLuigi) YouTube channel!
